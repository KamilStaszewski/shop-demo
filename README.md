### Tech

Shoppy uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [ReactJS] - for UI and UX.
* [Express.js] - for dynamic routing + creating api.
* [axios] - for fetching data from api.


Shoppy itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/KamilStaszewski/shoppy.git) on GitHub.

### Installation
